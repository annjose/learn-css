    <h3>Inline elements line wrapping the text</h3>
    <em>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
        standard
        dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
        specimen
        book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
        essentially
        unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
        and more
        recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</em>

    <h3>Elements with inline-block display type</h3>
    Below, both divs are 800 px wide and 100px high. The first div has the default inline display type, and the second
    one has the inline-block display type.
    <style>
        strong {
            background-color: peachpuff;
            border: 2px solid red;
        }
        .sample-inline-block {
            display: inline-block;
            width: 200px;
            margin-top: 24px;
            height: 40px;
        }

        .box-800 {
            width: 800px;
            height: 100px;
            border: 2px solid blue;
        }
    </style>

    <p>The Hello World text in &lt;strong&gt; below has the <em>display: inline</em>, the default value. So it does not honor the width, height or margin-top properties.</p>
    <div class="box-800">Some regular text
        <strong>Hello World</strong>
    </div>

    <br /><br />
    <p style="line-height: 0">However, the same text below has <em>display:inline-block</em>. So the block-level properties like width: 100px, height: 40px and margin-top: 24px are in effect.</p>
    <div class="box-800">Some regular text
        <strong class="sample-inline-block">Hello World</strong>
    </div>
</body>
